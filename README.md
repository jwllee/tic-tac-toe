# Tic Tac Toe game
This is my first exposure to the Django framework and pretty much the web
development process from start to production at Heroku. TBH, I was much more
interested in the AI part but packaging everything as a web app is a great way
to make things accessible.

## Features
- Minimax AI (alpha-beta pruning, transposition table, iterative deepening)
- Can pitch two AIs to play each other
- Configurable board dimensions (m x n) where 3 <= m <= 5 and 3 <= n <= 5
- Configurable number of connects to win game 

## Stack
- Django
- Bootstrap
- Ajax
- Postgres

## Implementation
To be updated...

## Acknowledgement
- Frontend design: copied the dark theme from somewhere but cannot seem to find the link back...
- Interaction between frontend and backend: https://github.com/paulcwatts/django-tictactoe
